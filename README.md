# 1y, even shorter than 11ty

**1y** is a short links redirector based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (a.k.a. 11ty), the Static Site Generator.

This is not really a link "shortener", as it doesn't process anything. Short and long versions of links are managed manually, so that short URLs can be "beautiful".

It can use Apache Alias or Rewrite module and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)'s [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/), depending on where you deploy it.
